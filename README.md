## Server for angular client

Server for [angular client](https://github.com/kdpisda/angularClientDjango)

The aim of the project is to make an open source CMS made in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.io). Basically it will use angular as front end and django as back end.

## Application Front end

The front end for the server may be found at [djangoServerForAngularClient](https://github.com/kdpisda/djangoServerForAngularClient).

## Running server in localhost

If you are using ubuntu or any linux flavour then follow this procedure.
> Make sure you have git installed in your system

Run following commands in terminal
> `git clone https://github.com/kdpisda/djangoServerForAngularClient`
> `source env/bin/activate`
> `./manage.py runserver`

Now open your browser and visit `127.0.0.1:8000`

Currently we are working on the architecture of the application. It will be uploaded soon.
